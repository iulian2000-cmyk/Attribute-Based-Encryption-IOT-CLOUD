## I. Purpose 
> This project was developed for education purpose only . It is an attempt to implement the PP-CP-ABE scheme in a specific context ,using Java and JPBC as main library . The goal of the project was to implement the mechanism behind encrypted storage on Cloud . 

## II . Context.
> Let's say that we have a number of companies,individuals,organizations whose data are stored encrypted on Cloud . This mechanism uses also elements from 
access control , mainly a variation from RBAC to ABAC . The idea is to ensure confidentiality , integrity and availabilty to our data which is stored . 
Each company,individual,organization defines a an access policy . An access policy is a method to describe the properties on which a user must satisfy in order to have access the data of another user .
